Extensions of Java Swing components which "bind" to objects so that the
object's value is automatically synchronized to the component's value.  
Certain components like JListBound and JComboBoxBound which implement 
dgu.util.swing.binding.delegate.BoundContainer are able to 
both show a list of what is some AbstractList (like a Vector) and
dynamically bind any member variables within objects in that AbstractList 
to their own bound components.
